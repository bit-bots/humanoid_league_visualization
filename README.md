# NOTE: This repository has been archived!

This is due to the removal of many old and unused visualizations and finally the replacement of our interactive marker implementation with https://github.com/ros-sports/soccer_vision_3d_rviz_markers

~~This repository holds different ROS visualisation tools made for the use in RoboCup Soccer Humanoid Leaugue.~~
~~See the README files in the packages for further information.~~
